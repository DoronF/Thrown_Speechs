# Statistical Text Mining of Standardized Political Documents

This project provides a complete, reproducible pipeline for analyzing the evolution of political discourse in Canadian Speeches from the Throne, from Confederation in 1867 to the present day. By applying a combination of modern data science tools, we can quantitatively map the thematic shifts in Canadian political priorities over nearly 160 years.

The corpus of Throne Speeches is uniquely suited for this analysis. As ceremonial addresses delivered at consistent intervals, they offer a standardized format that serves as a reliable index of governmental priorities, allowing for precise and comparable tracking of thematic changes across different eras and administrations.

## The Analysis Pipeline

The project is structured as a multi-stage data processing and analysis pipeline. Each step is designed to be reproducible, transforming the raw source material into a structured dataset ready for thematic modeling and interpretation.

### Data Collection & Preparation

* **Reproducible Corpus Creation: Scraping and Transcribing Throne Speeches**
    * **Objective**: To build a comprehensive and clean text corpus of all Throne Speeches.
    * **Process**: An index of speeches is scraped from the Parliament of Canada website. PDFs of historical speeches are transcribed using the Gemini 1.5 Vision model for high-quality optical character recognition (OCR), while modern speeches are handled through an interactive workflow.
    * **Output**: A directory of individual speech text files and a master index CSV file.

* **Segmentation of Throne Speeches using Gemini LLM**
    * **Objective**: To divide each speech into its distinct rhetorical parts.
    * **Process**: The Gemini LLM is used to segment the text of each speech into three categories: opening_ceremonial, policy_content, and closing_ceremonial. An interactive review tool allows for verification and correction of any segmentations flagged by the system.
    * **Output**: A structured, segmented corpus in CSV format, with each sentence categorized.

* **Exploratory Analysis of Throne Speeches**
    * **Objective**: To uncover broad, high-level patterns in the cleaned text data over time.
    * **Process**: An initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed on the policy_content sections, examining word frequencies, common phrases, and other basic text statistics by decade.

### Natural Language Processing

* **Boilerplate Identification**
    * **Objective**: To identify and isolate recurring, non-substantive formal phrases.
    * **Process**: The ceremonial sections are analyzed to find common, repeated phrases (n-grams), which are compiled into a "boilerplate dictionary". This dictionary is then used to filter these structural phrases out of the substantive policy_content.
    * **Output**: A regular expression (intrusion_regex.rds) containing all identified boilerplate phrases.

* **LDA Topic Extraction and Analysis**
    * **Objective**: To discover the hidden thematic structures within the policy content.
    * **Process**: Several Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models are trained with varying numbers of topics (k). These models are evaluated on metrics of topic quality and temporal balance to select the most coherent and historically representative models for final analysis. The models with k=4 and k=8 topics were chosen as they provided the best trade-off between topic quality and temporal balance.
    * **Output**: A set of trained LDA models (lda_models.rds).

* **LLM Interpretation of Topic Models**
    * **Objective**: To assign meaningful, human-readable labels to the machine-generated topics.
    * **Process**: To ensure speed and reproducibility, a Large Language Model (Anthropic's Claude) is prompted to interpret the word clusters for each topic. The LLM provides a concise descriptive label and a one-sentence summary for each topic.
    * **Output**: A file containing the LLM-generated labels for each topic in each model (llm_topic_labels.rds).

### Analysis & Insights

* **Topic Shift Analysis & Validation**
    * **Objective**: To visualize, analyze, and validate the evolution of topics over time.
    * **Process**: The prominence of each interpreted topic is plotted over time to reveal thematic shifts in Canadian political discourse. The resulting trends are then validated by comparing them against major Canadian historical events and periods of government, confirming that the model captures genuine shifts in political priorities.

## Conclusion

This pipeline demonstrates that a combination of modern data science tools can effectively uncover and quantify the evolution of political discourse from historical texts. The findings reveal meaningful patterns that align closely with Canada's historical trajectory, from its early focus on administration and development to its engagement in global conflicts and the recent rise of social and environmental policy concerns.
