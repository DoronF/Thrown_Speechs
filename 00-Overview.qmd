## **Phase 1: Data Preparation & Initial Processing**


* **1.1 Text Collection & Standardization**: A corpus of `.txt` files has been created by scraping, transcribing with the Gemini Vision API, and saving with standardized metadata.
[Scrape_and_Transcribe.qmd](Scrape_and_Transcribe.qmd)
* **1.2 Speech Segmentation**: Each speech has been programmatically segmented into `opening_ceremonial`, `policy_content`, and `closing_ceremonial` sections by prompting the Gemini LLM for a structured JSON output.
[LLM-Based Segmentation.qmd](LLM-Based Segmentation.qmd)
The LLM Segemntation identifies potential issues such as, low policy content, accessive uncalsified sentences etc. To review and make adjustment we use an interactive console tool - `interactive_segmentation_review.R`, to review the identified issues and make corrections as needed. 
* **1.3 Exploratory Analysis**: Speech length by decades, top words and n-grams etc. see [exploratory_analysis.qmd](exploratory_analysis.qmd)

## **Phase 2: Refined Boilerplate Identification**
The goal is to create a high-purity "boilerplate dictionary" by focusing only on the ceremonial parts of the speeches.

* **2.1 Ceremonial Language Analysis**:
    * Perform n-gram (2-gram, 3-gram) frequency analysis exclusively on the concatenated text of all `opening_ceremonial` and `closing_ceremonial` sections from the corpus.
    * Use TF-IDF analysis across these ceremonial sections to identify phrases that are common to nearly all speeches and thus have low informational value regarding specific context.
* **2.2 Boilerplate Dictionary Creation**:
    * Compile the most frequent and structurally significant n-grams (e.g., "Honourable Members," "My Government will," "May Divine Providence") into a "boilerplate dictionary".
* **2.3 Policy Content Filtering (Optional)**:
    * For certain analyses, use the boilerplate dictionary to remove ceremonial phrases that may have leaked into the `policy_content` section, further refining the signal for thematic analysis.

## **Phase 3: Policy Theme Extraction**
This phase focuses on identifying and clustering the core policy themes using the isolated policy content.

* **3.1 Semantic Clustering of Policy Content**:
    * **Topic Modeling (LDA)**: Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to the full, aggregated `policy_content` field for each speech[cite: 56]. This treats each speech's policy agenda as a single document, which typically yields more coherent topics. Use topic coherence metrics to help determine the optimal number of topics (`k`).
    * **Named Entity Recognition**: Extract specific entities (e.g., organizations, locations, legislation) from the policy text to ground the abstract topics with concrete details.
* **3.2 LLM-Enhanced Theme Identification**:
    * Use a powerful interpretation model (e.g., Claude) for nuanced analysis of the topics generated by LDA.
    * **Prompt Template**:
        > Analyze these policy excerpts from the [THEME NAME] topic, which were prominent in the [DECADE]s. Identify:
        > 1.  The core policy domains being discussed (e.g., economic, social, international).
        > 2.  The underlying values and assumptions reflected in the language choices.
        > 3.  Any direct response to the cultural or historical context of that era.
        >
        > *[Policy excerpts from the topic]*

## **Phase 4: Temporal Comparison & Semantic Change Analysis**
This phase tracks how policy themes and the language used to describe them evolve over time.

* **4.1 Longitudinal Theme Tracking**:
    * Plot the prevalence of each policy topic over time (by year, decade, or parliamentary era) to identify emerging, declining, and persistent themes.
* **4.2 Semantic Change Analysis with Word Embeddings**:
    * Train word embedding models (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) on the `policy_content` corpus, creating separate models for distinct eras (e.g., Pre-War, Mid-20th Century, Late 20th Century, Contemporary)[cite: 55].
    * Formally measure how the meaning of key concepts changes by comparing their nearest neighbors in the vector space across eras. For example, analyze how the context of words like "security," "family," "environment," or "economy" shifts over time.
* **4.3 LLM-Powered Pattern Interpretation**:
    * Use Claude to synthesize the findings from the quantitative analysis.
    * **Prompt Template**:
        > Compare the policy themes and language of the [1950s] vs. the [2010s]. Based on the attached data, identify:
        > 1.  How has the framing of persistent issues (e.g., the economy) evolved?
        > 2.  What new concerns emerge in the later era that were absent in the earlier one?
        > 3.  What does this suggest about changing Canadian cultural priorities?
        >

## **Phase 5: Synthesis & Cultural Yardstick Development**
The final phase focuses on interpreting the results and developing a framework for understanding cultural shifts.

* **5.1 Create Cultural Indicators**:
    * **Policy Priority Index**: A metric showing the relative emphasis on different policy domains (e.g., economic vs. social vs. foreign policy) by decade.
    * **Language Evolution Markers**: A curated list of key concepts and how their framing and contextual meaning have changed over time.
* **5.2 Validation & Interpretation**:
    * **LLM Sanity Check**: In the segmentation output, validate that the LLM's sentence boundaries are logical and do not contain obvious errors like overlapping sections. Review speeches flagged by the `needs_review` metric.
    * **Historical Cross-Validation**: Compare the identified shifts in policy themes with major, known historical events (e.g., wars, recessions, constitutional debates) to see if the data reflects real-world context.
    * **Expert Review (Human-in-the-Loop)**: Crucially, present the key findings and interpretations to a human expert (such as a historian or political scientist) for validation. The LLM analysis provides powerful, data-driven hypotheses that should be confirmed with subject-matter expertise.
